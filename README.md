## Project Overview
### Problem Statement: To develop a performance evaluation metrics system for the customer care department.
### Motivation:
- Until now, the employee performance was assessed solely by no. of prescriptions they type.<br>
- As the employee's position is multifunctional, they're also required to:
  - answer phone calls
  - return phone calls
  - solve customer service issues
  - follow-up with doctors’ offices and more
### Issue:
- Solely one metric is not enough to fairly assess their performance and rewards only that one job task.
- This in turn, creates less performance in all other areas except for typing in prescriptions.
### Solution:
- To develop a performance evaluation metrics system for the customer care department employees.
- This metrics should be able to reflect the performance evaluations at job position/designation level and further roll-up at the department level.
## Project Development Life Cycle
- Hybrid methodology used for development (agile + traditional).
