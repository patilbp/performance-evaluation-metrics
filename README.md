# Performance Evaluation Metrics System
<br>
<b> ## About Project Statement: </b><br>
<p><h8>To develop a performance evaluation metrics system for the customer care department.<br>
- Employee performance was assessed solely by no. of prescriptions they type.<br>
- As position is multifunctional, they're also required to answer phone calls and return phone calls, solve customer service issues, follow-up with doctors’ offices and more.<br>
- Issue : Solely one metric is not enough to fairly assess their performance and rewards only that one job task.<br>
- This in turn, creates less performance in all other areas except for typing in prescriptions.<br>
- Hence, to develop a performance evaluation metrics system for the customer care department employees.<br>
- Hybrid methodology used for development (agile + traditional).
